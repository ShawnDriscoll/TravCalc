   80286
     A CPU used by home computers in the mid-1980s.
     
   BASIC09
     A structured BASIC programming language dialect developed by Microware
     and Motorola for the then-new Motorola 6809 CPU and released in 1980. It was
     the best computer programming language until Python was invented.
     
   CMD
     Command Prompt (CMD) is a command line interpreter program available
     in Windows 10, 8, 7, Vista, and XP. Command Prompt is similar
     in appearance to MS-DOS.
     
   concatenation
     String concatenation is the operation of joining character strings
     end-to-end. For example, the concatenation of "iron" and "man"
     is "ironman".
     
   C
     A computer programming language used to write a better computer programming language called Python.
     
   CPython
     CPython is the default, most widely used implementation of
     the Python programming language. It is written in C.
     
   D100
     A 100-sided die. A sphere, basically. Rolled with caution.
     
   debug
     The process of finding and resolving of defects that prevent
     correct operation of computer software or a system.
     
   dice
     Small throwable objects with multiple resting positions, used for
     generating random numbers. Dice are suitable as gambling devices
     for games like craps and are also used in tabletop games.
   
   diceroll
     A Python module available from this `GitHub <https://github.com/ShawnDriscoll/diceroll/>`__ repository.
     
   egg
     Eggs are to Pythons as Jars are to Java. Python eggs are a way of bundling
     additional information with a Python project, that allows the project's
     dependencies to be checked and satisfied at runtime, as well as allowing
     projects to provide plugins for other projects. The most common format is the
     '.egg' zipfile format,
     because it's a convenient one for distributing projects. All of the formats
     support including package-specific data, project-wide metadata, C extensions, and Python code.
     
   errors
     Bugs that need to be squashed.
     
   FORTRAN
     A computer programming language used to play Star Trek games in the 1970s.
     
   game
     An activity engaged in for diversion or amusement. For computer games, it
     means no sweating.
     
   IDE
     An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software
     application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer
     programmers for software development.
    
   integer
     An integer is what is more commonly known as a whole number.
     It may be positive, negative, or the number zero, but it must be whole.
     
   log
     A log is a file that records events that occur as software runs.
     Logging is the act of keeping a log. In the simplest case, messages are
     written to a single logfile.
     
   module
     A module is a part of a program. Programs are composed of one
     or more independently developed modules that are not combined
     until the program is linked.
     
   no dice
     Used to refuse a request or indicate no chance of success.
     
   Python 3.8+
     A newfangled version of Python that's different from what Classic Python 2.5
     programmers are used to.
     
   rabbit hole
     Used to refer to a bizarre, confusing, or nonsensical situation
     or environment, typically one from which it is difficult to extricate oneself.
     
   random
     The lack of pattern or predictability in events. A random sequence
     of events, symbols or steps has no order and does not follow an
     intelligible pattern or combination. Individual random events are
     by definition unpredictable, but in many cases the frequency of
     different outcomes over a large number of events (or "trials") is predictable.
   
   Sphinx
     The Python software used to publish this operations manual.
     
   string
     A string is a contiguous sequence of symbols or values, such as
     a character string (a sequence of characters) or a binary
     digit string (a sequence of binary values).
     
   your own code
     Your own code is a Python program that you have already written to make calls
     to the ``roll()`` function.
