**Saved Data**
==============

*New in version 0.2.0*

The data of the generated NPCs will be saved in the ``data`` folder as a **JSON** file called ``TravLITE_NPCs.json``. The
file can be opened with a text editor. It can also be viewed somewhat better using the included ``JSON_pretty_print.py`` Python script.

A sample JSON pretty printing of the file looks like this:

.. literalinclude:: databox.dat
