**Alternate diceroll Distributions**
====================================

Often times, the **diceroll** module is found in other formats. You may already
have a copy of **diceroll** that was distributed with another program you're using.

Besides its common ``.py`` format, **diceroll** can be found in a ``.pyd`` format as
well. This format is packaged as a dynamic link library, and will work the same way as
the ``.py`` format. The format is typically bundled with the software that was designed
for using it.

.. Warning::
   The ``.pyd`` format can only be imported and will not execute at a CMD prompt.
