**Installing**
==============

Installing and using **TravLITE** seems simple enough. Just download the archive from `GitHub
<https://github.com/ShawnDriscoll/Traveller-NPC-LITE/>`__ and extract it to a folder you prefer.

Running TravLITE
----------------
If you have Classic Python 2.5.4 installed, you can start ``TravLITE.py`` from a CMD prompt or double-click
the Python script.

Alternatively, if you do not have Classic Python 2.5.4, you can start ``TravLITE.exe`` (located in the
dist folder) from a CMD prompt or by double-clicking the executable program.

Output to DOS has been depricated in this version.
