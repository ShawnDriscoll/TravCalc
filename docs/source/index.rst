**TravLITE Guide**
==================

What began as a DOS prompt NPC generator escalated into a web-browsed one...

**TravLITE** is an easy-to-use open source NPC generator for Mongoose Traveller 1st and 2nd Editions. It's written
in Classic Python 2.5 and includes **diceroll 3.1** for its die rolling. Source for **diceroll 3.1** can be found at
its `GitHub
<https://github.com/ShawnDriscoll/diceroll/>`__ repository.

**TravLITE** features minor logging and error tracking at this time.

This documentation explains how to install and use **TravLITE** for Traveller NPC generation.
